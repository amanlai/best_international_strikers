# International goals and games of Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar

Messi, Cristiano and Neymar are the only players to score more than 15 goals against top-15 FIFA ranked national teams since FIFA started ranking national teams. The Jupyter notebook here plots 3 pie graphs (1 for each player) where each wedge in a pie shows the size that player's number of goals is with respect to his total number of international goals. 

Moreover, among players who scored more than 30 international goals (as of 9/27/2021), every player who scored more than X goals against top-X FIFA ranked teams are listed (where X in [5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50]). For example, Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Suarez and Klose are the only players to score more than 20 goals against top-20 FIFA ranked teams.

The FIFA ranks come from [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cashncarry/fifaworldranking) and goal tallies were scraped from Wikipedia.
